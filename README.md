# WebMart (Static Demo)

Ultra‑premium peer‑to‑peer marketplace demo built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and modular vanilla JS.

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, **or** (recommended) run a local server:

```bash
# from this folder
npx serve .
```

Then open the shown URL.

## Notes

- This is a **front-end functional prototype**: cart, wishlist, comparisons, drafts, messaging, etc. are simulated using `localStorage` / `sessionStorage`.
- Product detail uses query params: `product-detail.html?id=p001`
